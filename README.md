# Simple OSS DB experiment with Neo4J

This is a simple experiment. It was tested only on PowerShell core on Mac OS X. Feedback welcome but use at your own risks.

Copy ```Config.sample.ps1``` to ```Config.ps1``` and adjust the configuration to your
local setup.

You can then experiment various queries from ```query.cypher``` in the neo4j
web interface.
